System design refers to the process of designing large-scale software systems that can handle complex tasks and high volumes of data while meeting the performance, scalability, reliability, and security requirements of the application.

System design typically involves breaking down the application into different components and modules, and designing each module to work together seamlessly to achieve the overall goals of the system. This process involves making decisions about the architecture of the system, selecting appropriate technologies, designing data models, creating interfaces and APIs, and deciding on deployment strategies.

Some key considerations in system design include:

Scalability: Can the system handle increasing amounts of data and traffic without compromising performance?

Availability: Is the system available and responsive to users, even in the face of hardware or software failures?

Security: Is the system secure against potential threats such as hackers or malicious attacks?

Maintainability: Can the system be easily maintained and updated over time as requirements change?

Cost: What is the cost of building and operating the system, and how can it be optimized?

System design is an important skill for software engineers, and is critical for building large-scale, mission-critical applications used by millions of users.
